# LLMany - A free and open-source LLM response aggregator service

## Overview
LLMany is a web-based service that allows you to send a single text prompt to multiple popular LLMs at the same time.

You can view each LLM's responses side-by-side as they arrive, giving you a breadth of artificial wisdom in a single place.

Additionally, a future LLM-powered compare service will be integrated, where multiple responses can be automatically compared to find and evaluate conflicting or conssitent information.
The goal with the comparison feature is to speed up the comparison process, and to detect information that is or isn't consistent across responses.


## The motivation for this project

The idea for this project spawned from the idea of "I wish I could send this single question to each LLM I use at the same time".

While there are numerous services out there that already do this, many are paid and/or closed-source.

The goal of this project is ***not*** to monetize this service, but to build a helpful tool for myself and provide the foundations to anyone else wishing to run this theirself.
